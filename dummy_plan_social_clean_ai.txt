A) Phases built from YOUR flowchart (simple + in order)
Phase 1 — User Onboarding

Flow: User Onboarding
Build:

Signup/Login

Verify identity (email/OTP)

Consent checkbox (must accept)

Output: user can enter app only after consent

Phase 2 — Define Scan Scope

Flow: Define Scan Scope
Build:

Form: name, aliases, platforms

Optional: upload image (store preview)

Output: saved scope ready for scan

Phase 3 — Demo Internet Scan Engine (Dummy) ✅ (your screenshot requirement)

Flow: Internet Scan Engine + Content Found?
Build:

Button: Start Scan

For demo: load dummy scan results (not real web)

If dummy results empty → END

else → show results page

Output: you can showcase product without real scanning

Phase 4 — AI Content Matching (Demo + Rules)

Flow: AI Content Matching + Confidence Threshold
Build:

Confidence score (dummy or rule-based)

Threshold slider (example 70%)

Below threshold → Ignore + Log

Output: low-confidence content automatically ignored

Phase 5 — Ownership & Control Analysis

Flow: Ownership & Control Analysis + Is User Owner?
Build:

Store per item:

isUserOwner (yes/no)

platformControlled (yes/no)

Show action buttons based on this

Output: correct actions appear per item

Phase 6 — Actions

Flow: Edit / Delete / Request Removal / Legal-Deindex
Build actions by content type:

Text / Caption / Comment

Edit (rewrite emotion/language)

Delete

Photo / Video

Remove

Replace

Not owned

Request Removal (template + steps)

Legal/De-index (DPDP/GDPR + DMCA + Google)

Output: user can click action and it updates status

Phase 7 — Confirm → Execute

Flow: Confirm Action → Execute Action
Build:

confirm modal with preview

demo execution (simulate success after 2 sec)

Output: actions change item status

Phase 8 — Track Status

Flow: Track Status
Build:

Pending / Removed / Rejected / Need proof

timeline per item

Output: user sees progress clearly

Phase 9 — Dashboard + Reports

Flow: Dashboard + Reports + alerts
Build:

counts + success rate

export PDF (optional in demo)

“reappearance alert” (demo text first)

Output: final SaaS feel

Phase 10 (After demo) — Real Internet Scan Engine

Replace dummy with:

Google/Bing search API

crawling + dedupe + storage

B) I also generated your Dummy Data JSON (20 items)

Use this in your demo website instantly:

Download demo scan request JSON

Download posts-only JSON

How to use (with your current backend)

Your backend endpoint expects:
POST /api/scan/start with body: { posts: [...] }

You can test like this (example):

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/scan/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: token=YOUR_LOGIN_COOKIE" \
  --data @socialcleanai_demo_scan_request.json


If you want, tell me which one you’re doing next:

Only Demo Website UI first (no backend call)

Demo UI + call your backend /api/scan/start

I’ll give you the exact folder + file changes for your current project.

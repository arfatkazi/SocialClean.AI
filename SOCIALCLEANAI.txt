🚀 DIFFERENTIATOR STRATEGY (vs. Redact.dev)

You said earlier you liked my 6 differentiator points — here’s how we’ll apply them practically to your current app:

1. AI Transparency Dashboard

Show users how the AI made a decision.

🛠️ Implementation idea:

In your Scan Results, add a “🔍 View AI Analysis” modal.

Display reasons why a post was flagged (e.g., "Contains toxic words: hate, dumb").

Backend: integrate a small NLP toxicity model (e.g., HuggingFace Toxicity pipeline).

2. User-Centric Data Control

Full visibility + delete option for all scanned data.

🛠️ Add a “Privacy Center” in Dashboard → Settings:

Show data retention policy (like “We store temporary analysis for 48 hours”).

Button: 🗑️ Delete My Scan History.

3. Emotion-Aware Analysis

Redact only when contextually negative.

🛠️ Add an emotion detection model (e.g., sentiment analysis).
UI Example:

Flag: “Negative emotion detected 😡” vs “Positive sarcasm 😊 — not harmful”.

4. Visual Toxicity Heatmap

A visual way to show how “clean” someone’s profile is.

🛠️ Add a heatmap or radar chart on the Dashboard:

Metrics: Toxic %, Private Info %, Safe %

Use Recharts or Chart.js.

5. Social Impact Score™

Turn your scans into an AI-driven “Digital Reputation Score”.

🛠️ Simple formula:

Score = 100 - (ToxicPosts * 3 + PrivatePosts * 2)


Show badge levels:

🌱 Beginner

🔰 Responsible

🛡️ Clean Professional

6. Privacy-first Offline Mode

Let users scan locally with an AI model without uploading.

🛠️ Use client-side AI inference (later phase):

Browser models via transformers.js (local LLMs).

Scan text before it ever leaves the device.

✔️ Router Configuration

✔️ Lenis Smooth Scroll Integration

✔️ Dark/Light Mode Compatible

✔️ Loading Screen Animation

✔️ Navbar + Mobile Menu (Animated with Framer Motion)

✔️ Footer Component

✔️ Hero Section with Background Video

✔️ “How It Works” 3D Swiper Section

✔️ Features Carousel (Swiper + Framer Motion)

✔️ Security Section (with Motion Animations)

✔️ Call-to-Action Section

✔️ About Page (Mission, Vision, Process, Team, Values)

✔️ Contact Page with Email Form

✔️ Login / Signup Page (with Google Auth redirect)

✔️ Forgot Password + Reset Password Flow
